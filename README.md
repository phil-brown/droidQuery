## droidQuery

### Introduction

__droidQuery__ is an Android *port* of [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery), and is designed to
be as syntactically alike as possible in Java.

For those not familiar with *jQuery*, it essentially provides magic for allowing the simultaneous
manipulation of a set of UI entities (using animations, attributes settings, etc), as well as to
perform complex tasks, such as asynchronous network tasks. *droidQuery* can do all of these things.

Essentially, *droidQuery* provides this same type of magic for the view hierarchy and `AsyncTasks`, and
can be used to perform other frequent jobs, such as showing alert messages. Also like *jQuery*,
*droidQuery* allows the addition of extensions to add to the power of the library.

Popular extensions currently available include [droidProgress](https://github.com/phil-brown/droidProgress), 
which can show a progress bar or spinner, and [droidMail](https://github.com/phil-brown/droidMail), 
which allows email to be configured and sent without using `Intent`. A full listing can be found on the
[wiki](https://github.com/phil-brown/droidQuery/wiki/Available-extensions). If you have created a new *droidQuery*
extension, please let me know, and I can add a link on the wiki.

*droidQuery* is intended to be used by all Android developers, as it greatly simplifies the procedures 
for performing many common tasks. *droidQuery* can also be used to help web developers that are familiar
with *jQuery* to get into Android development.

### How to Include droidQuery in your Project

There are three ways to include *droidQuery* in your project:

1. Clone the repo, import into Eclipse (`Import > Android > Existing Android Code Into Workspace`), and include a project dependency.
2. Include the full `jar`, which includes dependencies, available [here](https://github.com/phil-brown/droidQuery/releases/tag/latest), or can be generated using the *ant* `build.xml` script. You can tell these apart because they are named with the current version.
3. The __best way__ is to include each dependent `jar` separately. This will allow you to include projects with the same dependencies. Do this by grabbing the latest [release](https://github.com/phil-brown/droidQuery/releases/tag/latest) (this file is simply called *droidquery.jar*), then grab the dependency jars [here](https://github.com/phil-brown/droidQuery/tree/master/droidQuery/libs).

### How to Use

> Note: droidQuery is a work in progress. If you find any bugs or would like functionality that is missing, please create a new issue (https://github.com/phil-brown/droidQuery/issues).

Below are some of the most common tasks that *droidQuery* can be used for. A full list, as well as 
examples, is currently under construction in the [wiki](https://github.com/phil-brown/droidQuery/wiki/API-Documentation).
A sample application can also be found in the `droidQueryTest` directory. The relevant code can be found
in [ExampleActivity.java](https://github.com/phil-brown/droidQuery/blob/master/droidQueryTest/src/self/philbrown/droidQuery/Example/ExampleActivity.java).
You may also browse the *javadocs* [here](http://phil-brown.github.io/droidQuery/doc/).
Finally, most of the [jQuery API Documentation](http://api.jquery.com) is sufficient to explain the *droidQuery* API.

To **instantiate** a new *droidQuery*, you need to pass in a `Context`, a `View`, or set of `View`s. The
simplest way to create the instance is using the `with` static methods:

    $.with(Context);
    $.with(View);
    $.with(List<View>);
    $.with(View...);
    
If `Context` is passed, *droidQuery* will attempt to manipulate the root view. For example, if `Context`
is an `Activity`, the content view will be selected. There is also a way to select a `View` using it's id:

    $.with(Context).id(Integer);
    
or, for short:
    
    $.with(Context, Integer);
    
Once you have the *droidQuery* instance, you can either save it as a variable, or chain calls to manipulate
the selected `View` or `View`s.

**Ajax**

To perform an asynchronous network task, you can use *ajax*. The most straight-forward way to create and
start an ajax task is with the `$.ajax(AjaxOptions)` method. For example:

    $.ajax(new AjaxOptions().url("http://www.example.com")
                            .type("GET")
                            .dataType("text")
                            .context(this)
                            .success(new Function() {
                                @Override
                                public void invoke($ droidQuery, Object... params) {
                                    droidQuery.alert((String) params[0]);
                                }
                            }).error(new Function() {
                                @Override
                                public void invoke($ droidQuery, Object... params) {
                                    int statusCode = (Integer) params[1];
                                    String error = (String) params[2];
                                    Log.e("Ajax", statusCode + " " + error);
                                }
                            }));

**Attributes**

*droidQuery* can be used to get or change the attributes of its selected `View`s. The most common
methods include `attr()` to get an attribute, `attr(String, Object)` to set an attribute, `val()` to
get the value of a UI element (such as `CharSequence` for `TextView`s, `Drawable`s for `ImageView`s, etc),
and `val(Object)` to set the value.

**Callbacks**

The *Callbacks* Object provides a simple way to manage and fire sets of callbacks. To get an instance
of this Object, use `$.Callbacks(this)`.

**Effects**

*droidQuery* can be used to animate the selected `View`s. The simplest way to perform a custom animation
is by using the `animate(String, long, Easing, Function)` method. For example:

    $.with(myView).children().animate("{left: 100px, top: 100, width: 50%, height: 50% }", 400, Easing.LINEAR, new Function() {
    	@Override
    	public void invoke($ droidQuery, Object... params)
    	{
    		droidQuery.toast("animation complete", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT);
    	}
    });

It can also be used to perform pre-configured animations, such as fades (using `fadeIn`, `fadeOut`, 
`fadeTo`, and `fadeToggle`) and slides (`slideUp`, `slideDown`, `slideLeft`, and `slideRight`).

**Events**

*droidQuery* can be used to register events (such user input or view changes) on the selected UI elements.
This can be done using the following methods: `bind`, `on`, `one`, `change`, `click`, `longclick`, `swipe`,
`swipeUp`, `swipeLeft`, `swipeDown`, `swipeRight`, `focus`, `focusOut`, `keyDown`, `keyUp`, `keyPress`,
`select`, and `unbind`. For example:

    //Register a click event
    $.with(this, R.id.btn_refresh).click(new Function() {
		@Override
		public void invoke($ droidQuery, Object... params) {
			droidQuery.alert("refresh");
			refresh();
		}
    });
    
    //or use the "on" method to register a click event.
    $.with(this, R.id.btn_refresh).on("click", new Function() {
    	@Override
		public void invoke($ droidQuery, Object... params) {
    		droidQuery.toast("Refresh", Toast.LENGTH_LONG);
    		refresh();
		}
    });

**Selectors**

The real magic behind *droidQuery* is its ability to manipulate a set of UI elements at one instance.
a `View` or a set of `View`s can be passed to a *droidQuery* instance using any of the *with* methods,
or a new instance of *droidQuery* containing a set of *View*s can be created using any of the selector
methods, including `view`, `child`, `parent`, `children`, `siblings`, `slice`, `selectAll`, `selectByType`,
`selectChildren`, `selectEmpties`, `selectFocused`, `selectHidden`, `selectVisible`, `id`, `selectImages`,
`selectOnlyChilds`, and `selectParents`.

**Miscellaneous**

*droidQuery* also comes with several methods that simplify a lot of common tasks. including:

* __each(Function)__ - invokes the given function for each selected View
* __map(String)/map(JSONObject)__ - converts a JSON String or a JSONObject to a Map Object
* __map(Entry...)__ - quickly make a Map Object
* __entry(String, Object)__ - quickly make a Map Entry Object
* __alert__ - show an alert dialog
* __toast__ - show a `Toast` message
* __write__ - write text to a file
* __parseJSON__ - parses a JSON string and returns a JSONObject
* __parseXML__ - parses an XML string and returns a Document Object

**A note about Scripts**

In *jQuery*, there is an `Ajax` type called `Script`, which can be used to download a `Javascript` file.
This type also exists in *droidQuery*, but instead of `Javascript`, it expects a `Bourne` script, which
is runnable on the Android command line. Common usage for such a feature include running an existing script,
without the need to port to `Java`, or to run `Android Debug Bridge` (adb) commands. For example, say the
*POST* request to `http://www.example.com/settings` returns a `bourne` script as a response to issue a 
command based on the current application settings. The command, for example, could broadcast an `Intent`
to open an app:

    am broadcast -a android.intent.action.CAMERA_BUTTON
    
The request would likely look like this:

    $.ajax("{url: 'http://www.example.com/settings', type: 'post', dataType: 'script', data: '{id: 4, setting: 1}' }");
    
and as long as the request was successful, the native camera app would open once the response came back.

If the script does not issue an *adb* command, but instead calculates some data, the response would include the script
output.

**Special Thanks**

This project uses [AsyncTaskEx](https://github.com/commonsguy/cwac-task) to allow an unlimited number
of simultaneous network tasks. It also uses [NineOldAndroids](http://nineoldandroids.com) to provide 
animation support for Pre-Honeycomb versions of Android. CSS parsing is handled by [jCSS-Parser](https://github.com/phil-brown/jCSS-Parser), 
which I wrote with this project in mind. Finally, this project would not exist if it were not for the 
excellent *jQuery* library, and its excellent documentation.
